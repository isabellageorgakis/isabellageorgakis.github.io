      <h1>WHAT'S WHAT</h1>
      <h2>Canada’s Casino Industry Continues To Soar</h2>
      <h3>While the rules for Canada’s gambling industry are rather tough; with any venue, both brick and mortar or online, having to be licenced by the local authority, the Canadian casino industry has continued to grow in recent years.</h3>

        </h4>        

      <div class="text">

        <p class="intro">According to statistics, the casino industry contributes $31 billion to the Canadian economy each year, in which it is also predicted that the global worth of the industry will have risen to a staggering $500 billion by 2023.</p>

        <p class="para">Whilst the current climate has meant there have been a certain amount of challenges for physical casino venues, the growth of digitalisation has meant that the industry has still been able to thrive. So what are the gambling laws in Canada? How is the industry currently doing? And what casino gaming opportunities do Canadian citizens have?</p>

        <p class="subheader">What are the current gambling laws and regulations in Canada?</p>

        <p class="para">Whilst gambling is technically legal in Canada, it is governed on a local level by each of the countries 10 regions and provinces. This means that what applies in one part of the country, may be illegal in another part. The law states that all casinos, racetracks, lotteries and other gaming institutions, including national online establishments, must obtain a license from the local government and this determines what age you have to be to play.</p>

        <p class="para">In terms of online gambling legalities in Canada, the situation is classed as a grey area. Whilst online gambling institutions in Canada are illegal, players are able to access foreign casino sites. The area that becomes confusing is that players are only allowed to participate in gambling on Canadian shores if the local authority has licensed them, but since these online sites are not based on Canadian soil, the law can be interpreted in multiple ways.</p>

        <p class="para">One of the ways that many Canadian gaming organisations get around this rule is by basing themselves from the Kahnawake native reserve where a lot of Canadian laws do not apply. Whilst this is technically still Canadian soil, it is classed as native land and so regional laws are left to the reserve. Whilst the online gambling legalities are rather confusing for Canadian citizens, many people are still able to enjoy some of the best Canadian casino sites without any hassle.</p>

        <p class="para">The variety of different games available to Canadians on casino sites is large, with many hosting games such as poker, roulette and blackjack. A national favourite however is slot games with many providers now operating as an individual online slots site. The success of slot games is mainly down to the different themes, graphics and sounds which all contribute into making an online slot game the most attractive of all casino games.</p>

        <p class="subheader">What types of gambling are available to play in Canada? </p>

        <p class="para">Canada hosts a wide variety of gambling options both online and offline, from online casinos, betting sites and lotteries, to offline options including commercial casinos, racetracks, bingo halls, video lottery terminals and ticket lottery.</p>

        <p class="para">The gambling sector is incredibly popular with visitors to Canada, in which tourists can be seen to frequently visit the likes of Manoir Richelieu or at Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, the Niagara Falls Casino Resort, the Montreal Casino, or probably most famously, the Caesars in Ontario. The Caesars resort is one of the most show stopping casinos for tourists visiting Canada, with Vegas-style operations, live shows, restaurants and even a shopping complex.</p>

        <p class="para">In addition, Canadian citizens have a wealth on online options at their fingertips with there being more Canadian and international online casinos then ever before. As mentioned above, the Canadian online gaming market now contributes $31 billion dollars to the economy each year, but what are some of the reasons for this increase in growth for the online sector?</p>

        <p class="subheader">Increased Accessibility</p>

        <p class="para">The rise in online users of gaming sites is in fact not just a trend we are seeing in Canada but across the globe. As the number of online providers has continued to grow, consumers now have a huge choice of online casinos and gaming sites to choose from.</p>

        <p class="para">Whilst players were once confined to visiting physical venues, which involved time and travel restrictions, they can now access online gambling from the comfort of their own homes, on the commute to work or anywhere they choose with an Internet connection. What’s more, as the online gambling market is now so saturated, providers are coming up with a variety of offers and incentives for new and continuing players that make low risk play easier to access than ever before.</p>

        <p class="subheader">Advanced Marketing Methods </p>

        <p class="para">As we reach the height of digitalisation, there are more ways than ever before for online providers to ensure their online games are reaching people in even the most remote of places. From targeted ads that can appear across user’s multiple devices, to social media ads, email campaigns, TV commercials and so much more. Not only are we overwhelmed with options for online gambling; providers are incentivised to market their offerings in order to compete with others who share the online space.</p>

        <p class="para">Whilst gambling advertising regulations remain strict, one thing’s for sure – where there’s an Internet connection, there’s no doubt you’ll ever run low on online gaming options.</p>

        <p class="endp">Overall, whilst the Canadian gambling industry may seem more restrictive than the likes of Europe and similar markets; under the surface, there’s a huge amount of opportunities for Canadian citizens and tourists alike to participate in a range of gambling both offline and online.</p>
