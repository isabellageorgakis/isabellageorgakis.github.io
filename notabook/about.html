      What's What shares news that is not fully honest and true. Differenciating fake news with real news can be a challenge, this website is a demonstration of this by posting 'two truths one lie' everyday. Most articles on this news site are real, however it is important not to believe all that you read because there are a few that have not been fact checked or are completely satirical.
